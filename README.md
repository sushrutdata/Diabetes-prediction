##Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical attributes. The dataset, sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, includes diagnostic measurements such as glucose levels, BMI, and age. By employing machine learning techniques, this project provides insights into identifying high-risk individuals and aiding early interventions.

Objectives
Build and optimize a machine learning model to predict diabetes.
Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.
Dataset Details
The dataset contains 768 observations with the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (Î¼U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.
Age: Age in years.
Outcome: Target variable (1 = diabetes, 0 = no diabetes).
Project Workflow
Data Collection: Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize distributions, detect missing values, and examine correlations.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Normalize or scale numeric features as needed.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Train multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Optimize hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation.
Visualization:
Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Summarize results with Power BI or Tableau dashboards.
Performance Metrics:
Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and F1-score.
Tools and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
Visualization Tools: Power BI, Tableau
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees.
Results
The optimized model achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 90%.
Features like Glucose and BMI were found to be highly predictive of diabetes outcomes.
Ethical Considerations
Mitigated potential biases in data modeling to ensure fair and transparent predictions.
Ensured patient data confidentiality and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
Future Enhancements
